Depends on libhackrf, twolame (>= 0.4.0), and optionally soapysdr and ffmpeg
libraries.

* For Fedora (with rpmfusion)
yum install hackrf-devel SoapySDR-devel ffmpeg-devel


WARNING

The hackrf and other SDRs are not designed to be connected directly to AV
equipment and could be damaged by, or cause damage to, your receiver. Please
ensure no DC voltages or control signals are sent back into the hackrf, and
that the RF power levels out of the hackrf are not too high for your receiver.
